# Traffic-Sign-Recognition-with-Multi-Modal-Deep-Learning-and-Language-Models

The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in the transportation sector has unlocked numerous possibilities, especially in enhancing road safety and driver assistance technologies. This project is focused on creating an advanced traffic sign recognition system that employs innovative technologies like Large Language Models (LLMs) and YOLO. Unlike conventional systems that depend solely on image processing for sign detection, this approach incorporates real-time textual explanations of the identified signs. This dual functionality provides both educational and practical benefits to users.

A YOLO-based model will be utilized to achieve high-precision recognition of various traffic signs, including speed limits, road bumps, and pedestrian crossings. Once detected, the LLMs will process the data, offering detailed and context-aware interpretations of the signs, which will assist users in better understanding traffic regulations and safety instructions.



Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large Language Models are a form of artificial intelligence designed for processing and generating human-like text. Trained on extensive datasets, these models can comprehend language patterns, grammar, and context, enabling them to produce coherent and relevant text across diverse applications. Models like OpenAIâ€™s GPT exemplify the capabilities of LLMs in tasks such as answering questions, summarizing content, generating narratives, and offering programming assistance. LLMs play a critical role in modern AI implementations, such as virtual assistants, chatbots, and other natural language processing tools.


You Only Look Once (YOLO)
YOLO, a deep learning-based object detection system, is renowned for its ability to detect and classify objects in real-time. Its efficiency stems from processing entire images in a single pass, enabling fast and accurate identification of objects. This feature makes YOLO particularly suitable for detecting traffic signs, including those indicating speed limits, pedestrian crossings, or road hazards. By accurately localizing and categorizing these signs, YOLO provides reliable and swift recognition capabilities, essential for real-time applications.
